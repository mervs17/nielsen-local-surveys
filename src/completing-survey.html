                                        asks about the activities you like, your shopping, travel and entertainment
                                        preferences, and your media choices – which newspapers you read, what you listen
                                        to on the radio, and what programs you watch on TV or other devices. Retailers
                                        and media companies in your local area will use this information to better meet
                                        the needs of their customers. Your answers will represent thousands of other
                                        people who were not invited to take this important survey.

                                        between 755-0000 to 755-9999. This way we can reach a cross-section of the

                                        important that you complete the Television Diary as well as the Consumer Survey.
                                        You received the TV Diary to represent thousands of people in your local area
                                        since we cannot ask everyone about their television viewing.

                                        Diary, go through the checklist printed on the
                                        inside back cover of the Diary. Once you are sure that you have filled out
                                        everything, seal and mail it. To seal it, pull off the self-peeling sticker and
                                        stick the flap on the back page to the front cover. If you need to, it is okay
                                        to tape the flap to the front cover. Make sure that the address on the outside
                                        back cover is showing. No envelope or postage is needed.
